## ElevenLabs Music Prompt:
"Create an intense, high-energy electronic track with a fast tempo (140-160 BPM) that builds tension and urgency. The music should have a dark, competitive edge with pulsing bass, sharp synthetic percussion, and rising synthesizer sweeps that create anxiety. Include subtle glitch effects and digital artifacts that mirror the punishment effects in the game. The track should loop seamlessly and maintain constant pressure without being overwhelming. Think cyberpunk arcade meets reaction-time challenge - something that makes players lean forward and focus intensely. Add occasional staccato hits and electronic stabs that sync with a heartbeat-like rhythm to enhance the feeling of time pressure."

## Alternative Music Options:
1. **Calm Focus Mode**: Ambient electronic with subtle pulse
2. **Extreme Mode**: Drum & bass with aggressive breaks
3. **Retro Mode**: 8-bit chiptune style arcade music
