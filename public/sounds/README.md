# Sound Effects

This directory contains the game sound effects. For now, these are placeholder files.

## Files needed:
- `hit.mp3` - Success sound when hitting green target (short beep/ding)
- `miss.mp3` - Error sound when missing or clicking empty space (buzz/error)
- `trap.mp3` - Warning sound when hitting red trap target (alarm/warning)
- `gameover.mp3` - Game over fanfare (completion sound)

## Recommended sources:
1. **Freesound.org** - Free sound effects (requires attribution)
2. **Zapsplat.com** - Free with account
3. **AI Generated** - Use tools like SFXR or Bfxr to generate retro game sounds
4. **YouTube Audio Library** - Free sounds from YouTube

## Audio specifications:
- Format: MP3 (for compatibility)
- Duration: 0.5-2 seconds (except gameover can be longer)
- Sample rate: 44.1kHz
- Bit rate: 128kbps minimum
- Volume: Normalized to prevent clipping

## Cyberpunk theme suggestions:
- Electronic/synth sounds
- Retro arcade beeps
- Matrix-style digital effects
- Glitch/distortion elements

Note: Current implementation uses placeholder files. Replace with actual sound effects before production.
